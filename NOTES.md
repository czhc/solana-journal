## Resources

* [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) - Solana's Sealevel runtime framework
* [Program Derived Addressses (PDA)](https://solanacookbook.com/core-concepts/pdas.html): With PDAs, programs can programmatically sign for certain addresses without needing a private key. 
    * PDAs serve as the foundation for Cross-Program Invocation, which allows Solana apps to be composable with one another.
    * PDAs are 32 byte strings that look like public keys, but donâ€™t have corresponding private keys
